# ADVANCE RECON AND DISPOSAL UNTI(ARD)
“As we observe the difficulties faced at war field or border areas like Kashmir region, North eastern 
part of India such as terrorist attacks, which is destroying internal security. In order to overcome this 
circumstances we come up this idea which is very practical to implement and convenient. This robot 
mainly works for Surveillance (Wireless camera) in the sensitive areas where human life is at risk, 
also it detects the metal based explosives and helps to dispose to safer areas using inbuilt robotic 
arm. Built mechanism of this robot is such that it can tackle most of the difficult situation. The 
proposed system is very beneficial in the areas where there is high risk for humans to enter.”
